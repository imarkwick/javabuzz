# Javabuzz

An introduction to Javascript and Jasmine testing.

Write a simple program that you can play with in the console and return "Java" if a number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5, and "Javabuzz" if a number is divisible by 15.

To view the tests, run;

```sh
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

To play with Javabuzz in the browser console;

```sh
$ javabuzz.says(number)
```
